EXAMPLES:
    $: fern fmt         # will look for all fern.yaml files and run the 'fmt' target
    $: fern fmt --here  # will look only use the one in the current directory

CONFIGURATION:
    fern will look in $HOME/.fern.config.yaml or in $FERN_CONFIG for a configuration
    file for seeding.
    A sample config file looks like this:

    seeds:
      node:
        test: npm test
        fmt:  npm run prettier
      rust:
        test:  cargo test
        fmt:   cargo fmt
        check: cargo check
        build: cargo build --release
